Hi! Thank you for passing by.

I'm a passionate student doing my best learning C++ and graphical programming (as well as many other subject, as long as it is C++) through my personal projects outside my school life.

Some projects I worked (or am still working) on:
- [Akanya](https://github.com/DiantArts/Akanya): My biggest (personal) project I ever started... a Game Engine. I discovered OpenGL with it and made too many mistakes that I couldn't continue moving forward with it anymore. I did not give up though, as I started over with [ecs](https://github.com/DiantArts/ecs.git).
- [ecs](https://github.com/DiantArts/ecs.git): This project (still a game engine) uses an ECS architecture to correct the problems I had with the OOP in the [Akanya](https://github.com/DiantArts/Akanya) project. Even though it was going well, My ECS was starting to be dependent on the all engine I was building, especially OpenGL. That's why I decided to move a step back and start to correct the mistakes (and add some functionalities) of my ECS and put it into an extern standalone library. This ecs library is still in progress and I'm currently working in local until I learn about CI / CD (since unitary testing is not enough).
- [MmoNetwork](https://github.com/DiantArts/mmoNetwork): A project that was initially a school project, I decided to push it forward to implement it in my game engine later. The goal of this (yet incomplete) project is to use Asio to handle a massive amount of connected clients. Once the base is set up, this project will slowly turn into a project optimized for game engines.

All those projects, even though they are not completed, were very challenging for me. I learned a lot and will keep pushing them forward until I can finally combine them all into my game engine. Before that, I still have things I plan to do:
- Extract the ECS in the engine to create a standalone ECS library.
- Learn about CI / CD.
- Learn about Vulkan instead of OpenGL.
- Create a sound library, using OpenAL or something else depending on what I find.
- Finisd my [coding style](https://github.com/DiantArts/CodingStyle)

If you wish, don't hesitate to let me know what you think of my work at: evan.loiseau@epitech.eu, I would be glad to have external insights.
